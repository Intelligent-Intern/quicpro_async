### I. The Core Compute & Storage Fabric

This is the foundation of the new paradigm: native, high-performance data storage and computation built directly into the extension.

* **Native Object Storage (`quicpro-fs://`):** A fully-featured, MCP-based distributed object storage system. It will feature a `Metadata Agent` for the directory/object index and multiple `Storage Node` agents for sharded, redundant data storage (erasure-coded). This will be exposed to PHP through a native stream wrapper (`file_get_contents('quicpro-fs://...')`), completely eliminating the need for external dependencies like S3 or MinIO and providing the ideal data substrate for distributed training workloads.
* **Native GPU Compute Bindings:** Direct, C-level integration with GPU computing libraries (CUDA and ROCm). This bypasses PHP's FFI entirely, providing the absolute minimum latency for passing data between the network (via MCP) and the GPU. The framework becomes a first-class citizen for dispatching and managing high-performance machine learning tasks.
* **Native DataFrame & Analytics Engine:** The "Pandas" functionality, built directly into the extension as a native `DataFrame` object. It will use contiguous C arrays for columns and provide a rich API for high-performance, in-memory data manipulation, acting as the primary tool for CPU-based data analysis and preparation.
* **Optimized DataFrame Serialization (`IIBIN`):** The `IIBIN` protocol will be extended to natively understand the memory layout of the C-level `DataFrame` object, allowing for near-zero-overhead serialization and transport of entire dataframes between MCP agents.

### II. Elastic & Serverless Orchestration

The framework will not just run on infrastructure; it will manage it.

* **Dynamic Cluster Autoscaling:** The `Quicpro\Cluster` supervisor will be extended with the ability to dynamically scale its worker pools based on real-time load. The master supervisor can be configured to make API calls to cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Hetzner) to provision or de-provision entire virtual machines and automatically add them to or remove them from the service cluster.
* **Lambda/Function Pre-warming & Orchestration:** A dedicated agent that intelligently pre-warms serverless functions to eliminate cold starts. It will track invocation patterns and ensure that a pool of "hot" containers is always ready, making serverless a viable option for even low-latency tasks managed by the framework.
* **Declarative Circuit Breaker Middleware:** A native, C-level middleware that can be applied to any MCP client via the `Config` object to automatically halt requests to failing services, preventing cascading failures in a complex microservices environment.

### III. Advanced Networking & Service Primitives

These are the core networking features that enable the entire ecosystem.

* **Smart DNS Server:** A fully-featured DNS server, built as a `quicpro_async` application, that uses MCP calls to a `Cluster Health Agent` to return IPs of healthy, low-load nodes in real-time.
* **Stateless QUIC Router Tier:** A specialized server mode for L7 load balancing. These routers terminate no TLS but forward QUIC packets to backend services based on consistent hashing of the QUIC Connection ID.
* **Native WebTransport Support:** A first-class API for the modern successor to WebSockets, enabling multi-stream, unreliable, and low-latency communication for rich web applications.
* **SSH over QUIC:** An implementation of the SSH protocol running over a secure QUIC transport, providing resilient and fast remote shell access and command execution.
* **Native, High-Performance Security Modules:** The C-level, shared-memory based **Rate Limiter** and the configurable **CORS Handler**.

### IV. High-Level Developer Experience

These features make the raw power of the framework accessible and productive.

* **The Full Application Suite:** The complete set of agents for the Fleet Management use case, provided as production-ready examples: `Ingestion Gateway`, `Persistence Agent`, `Live Operations Hub`, `Auth Agent`, `Data Retrieval Agent`.
* **High-Level Event-Driven APIs:** The convenient `on('event', ...)` server APIs that abstract away all low-level loops and concurrency management.
* **Pipeline Orchestrator with Advanced Flow Control:** The declarative orchestrator with native support for loops (`ForEach`) and complex conditionals (`ConditionalChoice`).
* **Native OpenTelemetry Integration:** Built-in support for automatically generating and propagating distributed traces and spans across all MCP calls.
