// --- SCENARIO: A "Parameter Server" on a Hybrid CPU (Intel P-core/E-core) ---

/**
 * This server runs on a modern Intel CPU with both Performance-cores (P-cores) and
 * Efficient-cores (E-cores). The goal is to optimize network I/O by pinning
 * different types of connections to the appropriate core type, ensuring
 * that critical path operations are never delayed by background chatter.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL JUSTIFICATION: Why use QUIC in a Datacenter?
 *
 * While raw TCP or RDMA might offer lower absolute overhead in a pure HPC environment,
 * using the `Quicpro` framework internally provides a unified API for observability,
 * security (via optional TLS), and high-level abstractions like MCP for both
 * internal (East-West) and external (North-South) communication. This example
 * prioritizes a consistent development ecosystem over absolute minimal protocol overhead.
