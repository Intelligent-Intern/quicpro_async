/*
 * include/cluster.h â€“ Native Process Supervisor API for php-quicpro_async
 * =======================================================================
 *
 * This header file defines the public C API for the multi-worker process
 * supervisor integrated within the php-quicpro_async extension. It allows PHP
 * applications to spawn, manage, and monitor a robust pool of worker processes
 * using a C-native core for maximum performance and stability.
 *
 * Key Features Managed or Configurable via this API:
 * - Forking and supervision of multiple worker processes.
 * - Automatic restart of crashed workers with configurable policies.
 * - CPU core affinity for worker processes.
 * - Worker process priority (niceness) and advanced scheduling policies.
 * - Resource limits for workers (e.g., max open files).
 * - Optional privilege dropping for worker processes (UID/GID).
 * - Integration with Linux cgroups for resource isolation.
 * - User-defined PHP callables for worker lifecycle events and main logic.
 * - Graceful shutdown and inter-process signaling mechanisms.
 *
 * The C implementation ensures safe forking (typically before RINIT or in a
 * way that minimizes Zend engine conflicts in the master) and robust signal handling.
 * Argument information (arginfo) for these PHP_FUNCTIONs is in php_quicpro_arginfo.h.

 * PHP_FUNCTION(quicpro_cluster_orchestrate);
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Main entry point to initialize, spawn, and manage the worker cluster.
 * The C implementation of this function typically takes over the current PHP
 * process to become the master supervisor. It forks worker processes, which
 * then execute the 'worker_main_callable' from PHP userland.
 * The master supervisor monitors workers and handles restarts according to policy.
 * This function usually blocks and runs the supervisor loop until a shutdown
 * signal (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM) is received by the master process.
 *
 * Userland Signature (conceptual, defined in php_quicpro_arginfo.h):
 * bool quicpro_cluster_orchestrate(array $options)
 *
 * The $options array in PHP is parsed into the quicpro_cluster_options_t struct.
 * Missing options in the array will use C-level defaults.
 *
 * Returns: true if orchestration loop terminates normally (e.g., all workers exited cleanly
 * and no restart policy dictates further action), false on critical master
 * initialization error. Often, this function does not return to PHP if it
 * successfully enters the master supervision loop and is terminated by a signal.
 */

/*
 * PHP_FUNCTION(quicpro_cluster_signal_workers);
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Allows an external PHP script to send a signal to all worker processes
 * managed by an active cluster master. This usually requires identifying the
 * master process, e.g., via its PID file.
 *
 * Userland Signature:
 * bool quicpro_cluster_signal_workers(int $signal [, string $master_pid_file_path = null])
 *
 * $signal: The OS signal number to send (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGUSR1).
 * $master_pid_file_path: If provided, used to read the master process PID.
 * Alternatively, other IPC mechanisms could be used by the C impl.
 *
 * Returns: true if the signal dispatch was attempted successfully, false on error.

/*
 * PHP_FUNCTION(quicpro_cluster_get_stats);
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Retrieves statistics about the running cluster by communicating with the
 * active master supervisor process.
 *
 * Userland Signature:
 * array|false quicpro_cluster_get_stats([string $master_pid_file_path = null])
 *
 * Returns an associative array of cluster statistics (e.g., master PID,
 * number of active workers, individual worker status, restart counts, uptimes)
 * or false on error (e.g., master not found).
